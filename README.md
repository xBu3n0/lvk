# LVK: Little Vulkan Engine

The goal of this project is to learn how the Vulkan API works and to be able to deepen my knowledge about computer graphics.

## Dependencies:
 - Vulkan
 - Vulkan Validation layers
 - glslc
 - GLFW

## Build:
Compile the shaders using `./compile_shaders.sh` (If you are unable to run `.sh`, run `chmod +x ./compile_shaders.sh` before).

To run the project, run `make` (need `make`).
